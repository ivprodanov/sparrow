# üïäÔ∏è SPARROW

## A ‚Äúdescribe-it-yourself‚Äù design system built on Flexbox

**SPARROW** is an experimental, declarative design system for React. Rather than composing rigid UI components, you describe what you want‚Äîand SPARROW figures out the styles based on your words.

---

## üöÄ Why SPARROW?

Traditional component libraries can be opinionated or heavy-handed. With SPARROW, you define components through human-readable descriptions, and the framework translates them into styled elements using utility classes.

Example:

```jsx
<Thing description="a big rounded button">
  This is a big rounded button
</Thing>
```

Inspired by natural language and powered by utility-first styling (like Flexbox), SPARROW is meant to be playful, lightweight, and expressive.

## üì¢ June 2025 ‚Äî Now Open Source!

After much encouragement (thanks, friend üôå), I've decided to open-source SPARROW. I‚Äôd love for you to contribute, offer feedback, or just experiment with the framework.

Whether you want to tinker, optimize, or build‚Äîyour involvement is welcome.
