# SPARROW

## A design system based on flexbox

### Todos
- [ ] combine card properties in a reasonable way as to not bloat up the props in Thing Component
- [x] size of card -> solve!
- [x] Heights & widths utility classes
- [x] Text decoration and positioning utility classes
- [x] FIX -> Col-6 and others appear multiple times
- [x] margin-inline-auto (m-x-auto) should be added
- [x] Thing component -> add direct classnames support
- [x] Nested Thing Component -> Button in Card doesn't work currently.
- [ ] Fix -> breakpoints for smaller screens on all columns are missing! (investigate further - couldn't "reproduce")
- [ ] Add the grid system to the Demo component.
- [ ] Review and test grid again!

## Optimization:
- [ ] Optimize ComponentMappings (extract mappings | generic functions as helpers)
- [ ] className support for Things component -> analyze use cases.
